  abstract  = {Despite its age, SQL is still a widely sought skill among software developers and data engineers, which makes learning SQL a tempting prospect. Several online courses and tutorials may even inspire learners by stating that SQL is a simple and easy language to learn. This impression might also be strengthened by looking at simple SQL statements that read close to English, in contrast to most programming languages. In this paper, I will present ten complexities hiding behind SQL's initial appeal, and my experiences and possible solutions in mitigating these complexities in data systems education.},

  abstract   = {Codd proposed the use of two interpretations of nulls to handle missing information in relational databases that may lead to a 4-valued logic [Codd86, Codd87]. In a more general model, three interpretations of nulls are necessary [Roth, Zani]. Without simplification, this may lead to a 7-valued logic, which is too complicated to be adopted in relational databases. For such a model, there is no satisfactory simplification to a 4-valued logic. However, by making a straightforward simplification and using some proposed logical functions, a 3-valued logic can handle all three interpretations.},
